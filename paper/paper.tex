\subsection{Research context}
A core process for an agent dealing with uncertain knowledge is updating their worldview when new information becomes available, also called belief change. As an agent can be human or a machine work in belief change has impact on both philosophy and artificial intelligence \cite{Ferme2011}. Different approaches to handling belief change have been discussed with notable approaches including nonmonotonic logic, probabilistic reasoning and belief revision \cite{Darwiche1997}.

In belief revision, belief change is modelled using an operator that produces an updated set of beliefs from the state of an agent and new evidence. Research in this area discusses appropriate formalisations of agent state and constrains on individual or families of operators. Depending on if the suggested operator handles only one new evidence or multiple new evidences the approaches are called one-step or iterated belief revision.

A common tool used to encode plausibility assumptions of an agent about possible worlds are total preorders (shortened as tpos) \cite{Booth2011}. The primary article for this report, 'How to Revise a Total Preorder' discusses how to model the change of these total preorders when new evidence becomes available. Being able to derive a new tpo from additional evidence is an approach to handling multiple revision steps and therefor places the article in the field of iterated belief revision.

%\begin{itemize}
%    \item Introduction of the research area of belief change and major sub-areas according to \cite{Darwiche1997}: nonmonotonic logic, probabilistic reasoning and belief revision and placing of \cite{Booth2011} in the area of belief revision. Belief revision as operator based approach that concerns itself with the definition of constrains (so called postulates) on operators that transitions between held beliefs when new information arrives \cite{Darwiche1997}.
%    \item \cite{Alchourron1985} as seminal paper for one-step belief revision on belief sets. Definitions of belief sets and difference between propositional beliefs and conditional beliefs. Adherence to the principle of minimal change for currently held beliefs only; nearly no constrains on conditional beliefs.
%    \item \cite{Grove1988} introducing an ordered worlds / spheres approach instead of working on a set of held beliefs. \cite{Booth2004} understanding preorders as partitions into equivalence classes on ordered worlds (and using multiple orders). Iterated belief change as outlook.
%    \item \cite{Darwiche1997} discussion of iterated belief revision and the definition and need for epistemic states instead of belief sets for handling conditional beliefs. total preorders as plausibility orderings to represent conditional beliefs.
%    \item \cite{Booth2011} discusses a framework for tpo-revision that enriches an epistemic state with a framework to create a new tpo for a revision step on the basis of interval orderings between positive and negative representations of possible worlds. Motivation of tpo-revision as 'context' as introduced in \cite{Booth2007}.
%    \item Therefor \cite{Booth2011} as work in iterated belief revision, closer placement of \cite{Booth2011} as non-priotised revision on the belief set level.
%    \item Related areas to the framework established \cite{Booth2011} with preference aggregation and relation to research in interval orderings.
%\end{itemize}
%\textbf{Section Goal:} Overview of the research area and placement of \cite{Booth2011} as work on iterated belief revision. Rough overview of the background for the work in \cite{Booth2011}. Shared understanding of: belief revision (and the difference between one-step- and iterated belief revision), belief sets and epistemic states, conditional beliefs in contrast to propositional beliefs, tpos as plausibility orderings, motivation and definition of tpo-revision as tool for iterated belief revision. Section will need to be discussed with the seminar on \cite{Darwiche1997} and reduced depending on how much is shown in their presentation.<

\section{Formal background}

\subsection{Propositional Logic} % Aussagenlogik
Notation follows as used in \cite{Booth2011}: A propositional language $L$ generated from finitely many propositional variables, lower case greek letters for formulas in $L$ and $\top$, $\bot$ representing tautology and contradiction respectively. $\vdash$ as classical logical consequence, $\equiv$ classical logical equivalence. $Cn$ is used to denote the deductive closure of a formula or set of formulas in $L$.

$W$ is the set of propositional worlds (also called propositional interpretations in classical logic \cite{Kai2020}). Given a $\alpha \in L$ the set of worlds that satisfy $\alpha$ is denoted by $[\alpha]$.

For any set of worlds $S \subseteq W$ of worlds, $Th(S)$ is the set of sentences true in all worlds in $S$.

\subsection{Total preorders}
A total preorder is a binary relation $\leq$ (here over the set of propositional worlds $W$) that is total, reflexive and transitive (i.e. for all $x, y, z \in W$ either $x \leq y$ or $y \leq x$, $x \leq x$ and if $x \leq y$ and $y \leq z$ then $x \leq z$).

The symbol $<$ is used to denote the strict part of $\leq$ while $\sim$ represents the symmetric closure of $\leq$ (i.e. $x \sim y$ iff $x \leq y$ and $y \leq x$).

A helpful visualisation for tpos is shown in \cite{Booth2006}. It uses the fact that tpos can be represented as a linearly ordered set of ranks. Each rank of a tpo $\leq$ is defined as the equivalence classes modulo the symmetric closure of $\leq$: $[[x]]_{\sim} = \{y \vert y \sim x\}$. These equivalence classes are then ordered by the relation $[[x]] \leq [[y]]$ iff $x \leq y$

\begin{example}
    \label{example:example-introduction}
    As an accompanying example consider the following situation, closely aligned to \cite{Booth2011} and \cite{Darwiche1997}: 
    
    Our agent is a judge in a murder trial. John and Mary are suspects. $p$ represents "John is the murderer", $q$ represents "Mary is the murderer" and $r$ represents "the victim is an alien". Possible propositional worlds will be denoted as triplets of 0s and 1s denoting $p$, $q$ and $r$ to be true or false, e.g. the $101$-world stands for John being the murderer and the victim being an alien.
    
    To start the agent believes it is reasonable to assume the murderer acted alone (but are not ruling out both of the accused conspiring). In addition it would be extremely surprising (but not impossible) if the victim was an alien. Tpos are a common tool to handle preference orderings like these.
    
    
    Consider the propositional worlds $W = \{ 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111\}$. A tpo representing the judges assumptions would be $\leq$ with $010 \sim 100 < 000 \sim 110 < 011 \sim 101 < 001 \sim 111$. The equivalent representation as a linearly ordered set of ranks is shown in \ref{tab:visualising-a-tpo-example}.

\subsection{Belief sets and epistemic states}
A belief set is the deductively closed set of propositions an agent accepts as true at any given point in time \cite{Ferme2011}. AGM theory \cite{Alchourron1985} defines postulates for belief sets and their contraction, revision or expansion with new evidence.

Darwiche and Pearl \cite{Darwiche1997} argue that working with belief sets is not expressive enough for satisfying results in iterated belief revision. They make the distinction between propositional beliefs (i.e. beliefs the agent accepts and are part of the belief set) and conditional beliefs (i.e. beliefs the agent is prepared to adopt with new evidence).

While the AGM postulates define restrictions on revising propositional beliefs (a core one being the principle of minimal change), they place little restrictions on preserving conditional beliefs. In their paper Darwiche and Pearl use epistemic states, abstract entities that contain all information an agent needs for it's reasoning, especially their strategy for belief revision. As conditional beliefs are represented by these strategies, it is necessary to define how to modify the strategy itself when encountering multiple new information \cite{Darwiche1997}.

Belief sets can be extracted from epistemic states (the belief set extracted from an epistemic state $\mathbb{E}$ is denoted as $B(\mathbb{E})$).

\begin{example}
    Continuing example \ref{example:example-introduction} it is possible to model an epistemic state $\mathbb{E}$ with the tpo $\leq_{\mathbb{E}}$.
    
    A belief set can be extracted from it by considering the lowest ranked worlds (i.e. the most plausible interpretations) under $\leq_{\mathbb{E}}$. For notation let $min(\alpha, \leq_{\mathbb{E}})$ denote the set of minimal models for the propositional formula $\alpha$ under $\leq_{\mathbb{E}}$. Then $min(\top, \leq_{\mathbb{E}})$ is the belief set associated with $\mathbb{E}$.
\end{example}

%Katsuno and Mendelzon [17] propose that an epistemic state Ψ
%should be equipped with an ordering ≤Ψ of the worlds (interpretations), where the compatibility with Bel(Ψ) is ensured by the socalled faithfulness.
%Definition 1 (Faithful Assignment [17]) A function Ψ 
%→≤Ψ that
%maps each epistemic state to a total preorder on interpretations is
%said to be a faithful assignment if and only if:
%(FA1) if ω1 ∈ Ψ and ω2 ∈ Ψ, then ω1 Ψ ω2
%(FA2) if ω1 ∈ Ψ and ω2 ∈  / Ψ, then ω1 <Ψ ω2
%Intuitively, ≤Ψ orders the worlds by plausibility, such that the minimal worlds with respect to ≤Ψ are the most plausible worlds.


%Definition of the DP-AGM postulates and what modifications are made to them for the paper (to always be able to get a belief set from the tpo). Show how a belief set can be extracted from an epistemic state. Introduction of the notation of $\leq$ as tpo, $\ast$ as the revision operator for $\leq$ returning a new tpo $\leq^{\ast}_{\alpha}$.
