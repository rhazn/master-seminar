  abstract  = {Most approaches to iterated belief revision are accompanied by some motivation for the use of the proposed revision operator (or family of operators), and typically encode enough information in the epistemic state of an agent for uniquely determining one-step revision. But in those approaches describing a family of operators there is usually little indication of how to proceed uniquely after the first revision step. In this paper we contribute towards addressing that deficiency by providing a formal framework which goes beyond the first revision step in two ways. First, the framework is obtained by enriching the epistemic state of an agent starting from the following intuitive idea: we associate to each world x two abstract objects x+ and x-, and we assume that, in addition to preferences over the set of worlds, we are given preferences over this set of objects as well. The latter can be considered as meta-information encoded in the epistemic state which enables us to go beyond the first revision step of the revision operator being applied, and to obtain a unique set of preferences over worlds. We then extend this framework to consider, not only the revision of preferences over worlds, but also the revision of this extended structure itself. We look at some desirable properties for revising the structure and prove the consistency of these properties by giving a concrete operator satisfying all of them. Perhaps more importantly, we show that this framework has strong connections with two other types of constructions in related areas. Firstly, it can be seen as a special case of preference aggregation which opens up the possibility of extending the framework presented here into a full-fledged framework for preference aggregation and social choice theory. Secondly, it is related to existing work on the use of interval orderings in a number of different contexts. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

   abstract = {Prioritized bases, i.e., weakly ordered sets of sentences, have been used for specifying an agent’s ‘basic’ or ‘explicit’ beliefs, or alternatively for compactly encoding an agent’s belief state without the claim that the elements of a base are in any sense basic. This paper focuses on the second interpretation and shows how a shifting of priorities in prioritized bases can be used for a simple, constructive and intuitive way of representing a large variety of methods for the change of belief states—methods that have usually been characterized semantically by a system-of-spheres modeling. Among the methods represented are ‘radical’, ‘conservative’ and ‘moderate’ revision, ‘revision by comparison’ in its raising and lowering variants, as well as various constructions for belief expansion and contraction. Importantly, none of these methods makes any use of numbers.},

  abstract  = {This paper extends earlier work by its authors on formal aspects of the processes of contracting a theory to eliminate a proposition and revising a theory to introduce a proposition. In the course of the earlier work, Gärdenfors developed general postulates of a more or less equational nature for such processes, whilst Alchourrón and Makinson studied the particular case of contraction functions that are maximal, in the sense of yielding a maximal subset of the theory (or alternatively, of one of its axiomatic bases), that fails to imply the proposition being eliminated.In the present paper, the authors study a broader class, including contraction functions that may be less than maximal. Specifically, they investigate “partial meet contraction functions”, which are defined to yield the intersection of some nonempty family of maximal subsets of the theory that fail to imply the proposition being eliminated. Basic properties of these functions are established: it is shown in particular that they satisfy the Gärdenfors postulates, and moreover that they are sufficiently general to provide a representation theorem for those postulates. Some special classes of partial meet contraction functions, notably those that are “relational” and “transitively relational”, are studied in detail, and their connections with certain “supplementary postulates” of Gàrdenfors investigated, with a further representation theorem established.},

Contrary to the AGM framework, the proposed postulates characterize belief revision as a process which may depend on elements of an epistemic state that are not necessarily captured by a belief set. We also show that a simple modification to the AGM framework can allow belief revision to be a function of epistemic states.

  abstract  = {Total preorders (tpos) are often used in belief revision to encode an agent's strategy for revising its belief set in response to new information. Thus the problem of tpo-revision is of critical importance to the problem of iterated belief revision. Booth et al. [1] provide a useful framework for revising tpos by adding extra structure to guide the revision of the initial tpo, but this results in single-step tpo revision only. In this paper we extend that framework to consider double-step tpo revision. We provide new ways of representing the structure required to revise a tpo, based on abstract interval orders, and look at some desirable properties for revising this structure. We prove the consistency of these properties by giving a concrete operator satisfying all of them.},

   abstract = {Many systems that exhibit nonmonotonic behavior have been described and studied already in the literature. The general notion of nonmonotonic reasoning, though, has almost always been described only negatively, by the property it does not enjoy, i.e. monotonicity. We study here general patterns of nonmonotonic reasoning and try to isolate properties that could help us map the field of nonmonotonic reasoning by reference to positive properties. We concentrate on a number of families of nonmonotonic consequence relations, defined in the style of Gentzen [13]. Both proof-theoretic and semantic points of view are developed in parallel. The former point of view was pioneered by Gabbay [10], while the latter has been advocated by Shoham [38]. Five such families are defined and characterized by representation theorems, relating the two points of view. One of the families of interest, that of preferential relations, turns out to have been studied by Adams [2]. The preferential models proposed here are a much stronger tool than Adams' probabilistic semantics. The basic language used in this paper is that of propositional logic. The extension of our results to first-order predicate calculi and the study of the computational complexity of the decision problems described in this paper will be treated in another paper. © 1990.},

We characterize all the preferential inference relations that can be represented by this ordered set. As a particular case, we study the family of disjunctive relations, that is relations where a conclusion drawn from a disjunction of premisses can be drawn from one at least of those premisses taken alone. We show that for this type of relation, the associated model is injective and filtered: if two worlds m and n satisfy a proposition α and are not minimal for that property, then there exists a world p less than both of them that satisfies α. As we prove, conversely, that any filtered model defines a disjunctive inference relation, we obtain a representation theorem for these relations. Applying finally these results to the family of rational relations, we get a new proof of the representation of these relations by means of ranked injective models. © 1993 Oxford University Press.},

The two interpretations possess virtues and limitations that are practically orthogonal to each other. The conditional interpretations successfully resolve arguments of different "specificity" (e.g., "penguins don't fly in spite of being birds") but fail to capture arguments of "irrelevance" (e.g., concluding "red birds fly" from "birds fly"). The opposite is true for the extensional interpretations. This paper develops a new account of defaults, called conditional entailment, which combines the benefits of the two interpretations. Like prioritized circumscriptions, conditional entailment resolves arguments by enforcing priorities among defaults. However, instead of having to be specified by the user, these priorities are extracted automatically from the knowledge base. Similarly, conditional entailment possesses a sound and complete proof theory, based on interacting arguments and amenable to implementation in conventional ATMSs. © 1992.},

   abstract = {To choose their actions, reasoning programs must be able to make assumptions and subsequently revise their beliefs when discoveries contradict these assumptions. The Truth Maintenance System (TMS) is a problem solver subsystem for performing these functions by recording and maintaining the reasons for program beliefs. Such recorded reasons are useful in constructing explanations of program actions and in guiding the course of action of a problem solver. This paper describes (1) the representations and structure of the tms, (2) the mechanisms used to revise the current set of beliefs, (3) how dependency-directed backtracking changes the current set of assumptions, (4) techniques for summarizing explanations of beliefs, (5) how to organize problem solvers into "dialectically arguing" modules, (6) how to revise models of the belief systems of others, and (7) methods for embedding control structures in patterns of assumptions. We stress the need of problem solvers to choose between alternative systems of beliefs, and outline a mechanism by which a problem solver can employ rules guiding choices of what to believe, what to want, and what to do. © 1979.},

@Report{Booth2006,
  abstract = {Most approaches to iterated belief revision are accompanied by some motivation for the use of the proposed revision operator (or family of operators), and typically encode enough information for uniquely determining one-step revision. But in those approaches describing a family of operators, there is usually little indication of how to proceed uniquely after the first revision step. In this paper we take a step towards addressing that deficiency by providing a formal framework which goes beyond the first revision step. The framework is obtained by enriching the preference information starting from the following intuitive idea: we associate to each world x two abstract objects x + and x − , with the intuition that x + represents x "on a good day", while x − represents x "on a bad day", and we assume that, in addition to preferences over the set of worlds, we are given preferences over this set of objects as well. The latter can be considered as meta-information which enables us to go beyond the first revision step of the revision operator being applied.},
